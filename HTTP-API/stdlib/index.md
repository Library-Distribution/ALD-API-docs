The stdlib API describes the so-called stdlib, a list of items recommended to be installed for every user, which might possibly later be done by the AHK installer.

# Parts
The stdlib API consists of 4 parts:

1. the [Stdlib Release API](releases.html), which describes and manages the different releases of the stdlib
2. the [Stdlib Candidate API](candidates.html), which handles the suggestion and acception / rejection of new items for a future stdlib release
3. the [Stdlib Pending Items API](pending.html), which gives information about items which have been accepted, but are not yet included in a stdlib release
4. the [Stdlib Items API](items.html) for general information on items and their inclusion in stdlib releases

Visit the individual documentation for further information (Note that the docs are pretty much incomplete at the moment).
